			<h1 style="font-family:georgia">WHAT IS MOTSDRAMA.COM? AND WHAT'S WITH THAT NAME, HUH?</h1>
			<p>well first of all, stop yelling. it's giving me a headache. second of all, motsdrama.com is a host for all of my creative endeavors, ideas, projects, thoughts, discoveries, and much, MUCH more.
			as for the name, it refers to a phenomenon known to happen in a favorite game of mine, Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne. near the end of the game (no spoilers, of course) you fight a boss named Mot. 
			he has the ability to give himself infinite turns in battle using a move called Beast Eye. think of it like a "using wishes to wish for more wishes" sort of deal. this leads to a difficult and 
			often comedic battle where the boss will give himself a ton of turns, and then wipe the floor with your party. the Japanese community dubbed this occurence... 
			</p>
			<h1>"モト劇場"</h1><h3>(Mot's Theater, or Mot's Drama)</h3>
			<p>
			since it's like he's the one running the entire battle. 
			now, this leads to the next obvious question. why did i name my website that? well, the real answer is that i thought that was a really cool sounding name and thought it'd make for a good username,
			but i already have an established username online. so i decided to give it to this website instead.
